References to get informed about git:

Be wise! Git doesn't mean only GitHub, Git is a version control tool, and GitHub is a website for hosting code that utilizes the Git tool, there are many different code hubs all over the internet such as GitLab and BitBucket

## SSH Authentication
After your sign-up in a Code hub it's interesting, security wise, to add a SSH Authentication to your account, so only with this key you can clone your private repositories and push with your profile authenticated with SSH security.
